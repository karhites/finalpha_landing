COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH REPORT: BATTERY SUPPLY CHAIN FOR AI DATA CENTERS
================================================================================
Research Date: November 6, 2025


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

The battery supply chain for AI data centers represents a critical bottleneck
in the AI infrastructure buildout, with data center power consumption projected
to grow 165% by 2030. The market is characterized by extreme geographic
concentration (China controls 80% of battery cell production and 85% of cathode
materials), creating significant supply chain vulnerabilities and investment
opportunities in Western alternatives.

Current battery materials markets face oversupply conditions that have depressed
stock prices, creating potential entry points for long-term investors positioned
for the 2027-2030 demand surge.

2. Data Center Battery Market is Growing Fast: $3.4B → $12B by 2032, driven
   by AI power demands growing 165% by 2030

3. Current Oversupply Creates Entry Points: Lithium, graphite, nickel all at
   multi-year lows; quality company stocks down 35-58%

4. Government Support is Strong: IRA credits, DOE loans, DoD partnerships
   de-risk Western supply chain investments

5. Best Opportunities Are:
   - Profitable + Growing + Depressed: Aspen Aerogels, NEO Performance Materials
   - Strategic + Government Backed: MP Materials, Standard Lithium
   - Speculative Long-Term: Nouveau Monde Graphite, Piedmont Lithium

6. Avoid: Companies with collapsing revenue (Energy Vault), exploding losses
   (Novonix), or in pre-revenue development without near-term catalysts

7. Timeline: Buy now during oversupply (2025), hold through deficit period
   (2027-2030) as AI data center buildout accelerates

8. Risk Management: Market cap concentration in small-caps ($126M-$650M) means
   high volatility; use position sizing and dollar-cost averaging


8. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH NEEDED
================================================================================

Before investing, further due diligence on:

1. Latest quarterly earnings for NEO Performance Materials and Aspen Aerogels
2. Estonia facility progress for NEO Performance Materials (should be 90%+

   points)
5. DoD contract details for MP Materials (10-year price floor mechanics)
6. Insider buying/selling patterns for all recommended stocks
7. Short interest levels (high short interest could indicate undiscovered
   problems or squeeze opportunity)
